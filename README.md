# Getting Started with Create React App

This project is a hello world example showing how pix3d can be mixed in a react-pixi project via custom components.

 I simply mixed and matched the custom component example in this link

[ react-pixi custom components ] (https://reactpixi.org/custom-components)

and the pixi3d api example in this link

[pixi3d api docs] (https://github.com/jnsmalm/pixi3d#getting-started)
