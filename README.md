# Getting Started with react-pixi and pixi3d

This project is a hello world example showing how pix3d can be mixed in a react-pixi project via custom components.

 I simply mixed and matched the custom component example in this link

(react-pixi custom components)[https://reactpixi.org/custom-components]

and the pixi3d api example in this link
